# Image Text Extract and Translation

![Image-Text-Translator Application](docs/image-text-translator-amalgam.jpg)
## Overview

An application that allows a user to upload an image containing text. The text will be extracted, and translated to any selected language.

E.g. A user wants to translate a meme in Ukrainian, to English.

It is built using:

- Python Flask for the UI
- Event driven functions for the backend
- Google Cloud serverless components for hosting: i.e. Cloud Run and Cloud Functions
- Google pre-built ML APIs for the extraction and translation

## Walkthrough and Detailed Guide

Check out my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/google-cloud/building-a-serverless-image-text-extractor-and-translator-using-google-cloud-pre-trained-ai-adfdccdb18d9), where I describe:

- How the solution is architected
- Design choices and rationale
- A walkthrough of how you can do the same, end-to-end, including:
  - Dev environment setup (including Google Cloud SDK, VS Code, Cloud Code)
  - Service accounts and roles
  - Application Default Credentials (ADC)
  - The coding for the UI (Python, Flask, Jinja templates) and backend (Python)
  - How to test locally
  - How to deploy to Google Cloud (using Google Artifact Registry and Cloud Build)
- Cost management tips
- Performance tips
